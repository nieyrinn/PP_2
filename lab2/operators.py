#Ex 1
#In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5)

#Ex 2
#Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

#Ex 3
#Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

#Ex 4
#Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
